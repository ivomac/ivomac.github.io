      <h3>Conformal and chiral phase transitions in Rydberg chains</h3>
    </header>

    <p>
      New experimental techniques let physicists build arrays of atoms suspended with lasers and magnetic fields, and
      manipulate how they interact with each other in a way that used to only be accessible through computer
      simulations.
      Recent experiments created chains of 51 atoms and saw them undergo <b>phase transitions</b>: sudden changes
      in the chain's quantum state.
    </p>

    <h4>Phase Transitions</h4>
    <p>
      Phase transitions are quantified by their <b>critical exponents</b>: a set of numbers that are universal, in that
      the same phase transition can be observed in many seemingly unrelated systems, and in each of them the same
      <b>critical exponents</b> will be measured.
      The particular phase transitions observed in this experiment are not fully understood, and their associated
      critical exponents (estimated from experimental measurements) are not knowne exactly.
    </p>

    <h4>Experimental Results</h4>
    <p>A crucial exponent of the phase transitions observed is the KZ exponent. The experimental results were:</p>

    <p>For 1/3 phase: KZ ≈ 0.38. For 1/4 phase: KZ ≈ 0.25</p>

    <p>
      A crucial element that can affect the accuracy of the exponent estimation is the size of the system, or the total
      number of atoms, 51 in this case.
    </p>

    <h4>Numerical approach</h4>
    <p>We used a powerful computational method (<b>DMRG</b>) to calculate
      these exponents and to understand what system sizes are needed to reach very high accuracy. This technique allows
      us to simulate quantum systems at system sizes much larger than 51.</p>

    <p>
      A key step was to find the correct conditions in the system where complicating factors (like
      <b>chiral perturbations</b>) are reduced, to be able to study the more fundamental transition and its
      neighborhood.
    </p>

    <h4>Results</h4>
    <p>Our calculations estimate the exponents as:</p>

    <p>For 1/3 phase: KZ ≈ <b>0.4545</b>. For 1/4 phase: KZ ≈ <b>0.444</b></p>

    <p>
      Both significantly higher than the experimental estimates. Our work provides precise references for the
      experimenters to calibrate their setups. We also show that with only 51 atoms, the experimental systems are too
      small to show the true phase transition behavior.
