      <h3>Perturbative approach to tunneling and quantum interferences in spin clusters</h3>
    </header>

    <p>
      The spin is a vector property of elementary particles like electrons. The spin property is often abstracted
      and considered on its own, as an arrow pointing in some direction. We can force the spin to be in a certain axis,
      so that it is in one of two states, usually "up" or "down". These spins can be used as ultra-compact data storage
      or as qubits in a quantum computer.
    </p>

    <h4>Quantum Tunneling</h4>
    <p>
      The spin can randomly jump between "up" or "down" due to quantum tunneling, making us lose information. We could
      try to quantify this phenomena with the probability that the spin flips over some time period.
    </p>

    <p>
      Quantum tunneling of a single isolated spin can be easily understood mathematically, but it becomes much more
      complex when we have many spins close together so that they interact with each other. In this case, the random
      spin flip events can be collective: There is a non-zero probability that several spins flip <i>simultaneously</i>,
      and it is not a simple function of the probability of a single spin. For example, four spins in a row in the state
      ↑↓↓↑ could suddenly tunnel to the state ↓↑↓↓.
    </p>

    <h4>Our contribution</h4>
    <p>
      To properly understand the state of the system, we must be able to calculate the tunneling rate between any two
      possible configurations of spins. In this paper, we show that for some geometries of spin clusters it is possible
      to approximately calculate the tunnelling rates for any cluster size (or number of spins). Our method is also
      efficient enough that it can be applied to arbitrary spin clusters with some computer assistance.
      Our methods also provided more insight on the origin of the level crossings observed in experiments with arrays of
      spins/atoms.
