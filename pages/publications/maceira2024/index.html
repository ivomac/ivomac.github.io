      <h3>Thermalization dynamics in closed quantum many-body systems: A precision large-scale exact
        diagonalization study</h3>
    </header>

    <p>
      If you mix a cold system with a hot system, energy will disperse over time until the temperature is uniform
      everywhere. Once this <i>thermal equilibrium</i> is reached, it is not easy to tell if the system was ever
      separated into hot and cold. That kind of information is "scrambled".
    </p>

    <p>
      Now, take a system of many interacting quantum particles. Start the system in a specific, organized configuration
      with fixed total energy, and then let it evolve according to quantum mechanics. <b>Does the system eventually
        reach a state that looks just like thermal equilibrium at that energy?</b> This phenomena is what
      <b>thermalization</b> refers to.
    </p>

    <p>
      This work provides very precise computational evidence of exactly how isolated quantum systems thermalize,
      validating what theory has predicted. We also explore thermalization beyond what is currently known from theory.
    </p>

    <h3>Main Results</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        The systems do eventually look thermal, with small deviations that are measured precisely.
      </li>

      <li>
        There's a theory called the "Eigenstate Thermalization Hypothesis" (ETH) that predicts exactly how these small
        deviations should behave, and our results match these predictions very well.
      </li>

      <li>
        We compared how much information gets "lost" or "scrambled", and we find it matches what you'd expect from a
        thermal system.
      </li>

      <li>
        We observed that the system approaches equilibrium through an exponential decay process, with timescales that
        grow linearly with the system size and depend on energy. The reason for the exact linear scaling is an open
        question where the theory has not reached to yet.
      </li>
