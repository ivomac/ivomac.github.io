      <h3>Evolution of localized states in Lieb lattices under time-dependent magnetic fields</h3>
    </header>

    <!-- We investigated how electrons behave in special crystal structures with <b>flat bands</b> when we slowly change a magnetic field applied to them. -->

    <p>
      In normal materials, electrons have different energies depending on their momentum: Faster-moving electrons have
      higher energy. But in flat-band systems, we have groups of electrons that all share the <i>exact same energy</i>
      regardless of their momentum. This creates what is called a "flat band" in the energy spectrum.
    </p>

    <h4>The Lieb Lattice</h4>
    <p>
      When we apply a magnetic field to these systems, they usually lose their flat-band property entirely. However,
      some, like the Lieb lattice we studied, are more robust. They keep their flat-band even with the magnetic field
      present.
    </p>

    <p>
      In the Lieb lattice, the system has both a flat band and normal dispersive bands that meet at special points
      called <b>Dirac points</b>. As we change the magnetic field strength, these Dirac points periodically appear and
      disappear while the flat band persists.
    </p>

    <h4>The Lieb Lattice</h4>
    <p>
      We wanted to understand what happens to the flat-band electrons when we slowly change the magnetic field over
      time.
      According to quantum mechanics principles, if we change things slowly enough, an electron that starts in a
      particular quantum state should smoothly follow that state as it evolves.
    </p>

    <p>
      However, as the magnetic field changes in our system, the energy levels periodically cross each other at the Dirac
      points. At these crossing points, the state of the trapped
      electrons can fundamentally change: The electrons might gain/lose energy and leave the flat-band.
    </p>

    <h4>Quantum system as physical precession</h4>
    <p>
      We showed that near these energy crossing points, we can simplify our complex many-electron system into a
      much simpler <b>three-level system</b>: one flat-band level with zero energy, and two levels representing the
      mobile electrons.
    </p>

    <p>
      When we slowly change the magnetic field, the trapped electrons exhibit a <i>precession behavior</i>: They
      oscillate around a nearly constant state, but with sharp changes whenever energy levels cross. This is similar to
      how a spinning top precesses around the vertical axis.
    </p>

    <p>
      This research helps us understand how to control quantum states in engineered materials. The precession behavior
      we observed is caused by an effective electric field that emerges from the changing magnetic field, which breaks
      the natural symmetry of the system.
