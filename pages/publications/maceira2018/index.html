      <h3>Infinite coherence time of edge spins in finite-length chains</h3>
    </header>

    <p>
      In quantum systems, a common challenge is <b>decoherence</b>: the state of quantum systems can be easily disrupted
      by interactions with the environment, limiting their long-term use. However, some quantum systems can be in
      states that are much more robust to perturbations.
    <p>

    <h4>Quasiparticles</h4>

    <p>
      These robust states are conceptualized as quasi-particles: collective states that behave like particles but are
      not true particles themselves. They are not easily controllable or accessible experimentally.
    </p>

    <h4>Zero modes</h4>

    <p>
      One-dimensional arrays of magnetic atoms are well-known to have such "robust" quasi-particles which are also very
      localized at the edges of the arrays, and so they are closely related to the atoms at the edges.
    </p>

    <p>
      These states have zero energy in the scale of the system, and are often called "zero modes". In contrast with
      other states, their energy is not sensitive to (most) perturbations and remains zero. This is one of the ways
      their robustness manifests. However, these edge states are only truly "zero modes" (zero energy) when the array
      size (number of atoms) is much larger than the "quasiparticle size", or roughly how many atoms at the edge does it
      "occupy".
    </p>

    <h4>Our paper</h4>

    <p>
      Recent experiments built one-dimensional arrays which have regular level crossings of its lowest energy state. In
      this paper, we demonstrate that at these level crossings, the system has exact "zero modes", no matter the system
      length. This means that it is possible to tune the parameters of a finite system such that a "zero mode" exists,
      and we show that this implies the system's edge spins remain coherent.
