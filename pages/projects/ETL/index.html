    <h2><a href="https://github.com/ivomac/rcell-convert">🔧 ETL pipeline</a></h2>
    <p>
      As my main project at the LNMC group of the Blue Brain Project, I worked in developing an ETL pipeline for
      electrophysiological time series data. It monitors incoming raw data from several robots which conduct automated
      patch-clamp experiments on single cells to determine the effects of drugs on ion channels.
    </p>
    <p>
      The pipeline uses Dagster and is deployed through Docker on an internal server. The raw measurements and
      metadata of
      each experiment are validated and converted to an internal HDF5 specification. Once converted and stored on the
      server, the new data is analysed together with the previous experiments by the scientist on Python notebooks
      through a statistical analysis pipeline.
    </p>
    <p>
      I made available a part of the code responsible for general validation and conversion of data and specific
      conversion scripts for one of the robots: <a href="https://github.com/ivomac/rcell-convert">Github</a>.

    <p>
      For more information on the project, see <a href="https://channelpedia.epfl.ch/drug_mapping">Channelpedia</a>,
      where the drug screening results are made available, among others.
