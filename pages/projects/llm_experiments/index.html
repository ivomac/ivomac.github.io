    </h2>

    <p>
      LLMs often hallucinate or show overconfidence when giving information. This is a huge block in their reliability
      and potential usage as independent thinking agents.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this project I studied the effect of instructing LLMs to not answer a question if they don't
      know the answer, and then ask it questions on obscure facts. I analyse the effects of the prompt on accuracy,
      changes in the fraction of "correct", "incorrect", and "don't know" answers.
    </p>
    <p>
      The results show that most models are more likely to say "I don't know" when they had previously
      answered incorrectly, resulting in higher accuracy. Some model dependence is observed that seems dependent on
      whether the model "reasons", with reasoning models saying "I don't know" less often.
