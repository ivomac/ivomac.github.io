    <h2><a href="https://github.com/ivomac/blackjack.git">üÉè Blackjack Solver</a></h2>
    <p>
      I wrote a blackjack solver which finds the optimal playing strategy with a dynamic programming algorithm. The
      player's full hand composition and the deck composition are considered.
    </p>
    <p>
      It's available on <a href="https://github.com/ivomac/blackjack.git">Github</a>, with a description of the
      algorithm and a solution to the game.
