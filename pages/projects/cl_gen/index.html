    <p>
      During my time searching for jobs I found myself spending too much time writing tailored cover letters, when
      in fact the final cover letter contained much of the same content as my past letters.
    </p>
    <p>
      To speed up the process, I wrote a small LLM RAG pipeline to:
    <ul>
      <li>1. Go through my past cover letters, and retrieve the sentences in their body text with a small LLM.</li>
      <li>2. Cluster the sentences into labelled clusters with HDBSCAN and an open-source embedding model.</li>
      <li>3. Sort the clusters given their similarity to a job posting using the same embedding.</li>
      <li>4. Generate a cover letter using a medium-sized LLM given the sorted clusters and job posting.</li>
    </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      It's available on <a href="https://github.com/ivomac/cl-gen">Github</a>.
