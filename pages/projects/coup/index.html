    <h2><a href="https://github.com/ivomac/pettingzoo-coup.git">🗡️ PettingZoo Coup API</a></h2>
    <p>
      An implementation of the hidden information card game <a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coup_(card_game)">Coup</a> as a <a
        href="https://gymnasium.farama.org/">Gymnasium</a>/<a href="https://pettingzoo.farama.org/">PettingZoo</a>
      environment.
    </p>
    <p>
      In Coup, players want to attack and remove other players' cards and win by being the last player standing with
      cards. Players may, and often should, lie about the hidden roles they are holding in their hand, but they risk
      losing cards if they are caught. To play well, players should keep track of each other's actions throughout
      the game and play the odds set by the cards.
    </p>
    <p>
      Being a stochastic multi-agent game like Poker, the optimal strategy would be defined as a Nash equilibrium. Many
      game situations are not trivial to solve, and may lead to stand-offs where no player wants to attack first.
      Reinforcement learning methods like "Counterfactual Regret Minimization" can find a Nash equilibrium by training a
      model through self-play.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gymnasium is a reinforcement learning library that specifies a standard API for creating single-agent
      environments, while PettingZoo is the Gymnasium extension for multi-agent environments. I implemented Coup as a
      PettingZoo AEC environment with the goal of training an agent through self-play (WIP).

      More information on the game and implementation is available on the <a
