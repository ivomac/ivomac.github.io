        A collection of Yes/No Games collected from books and the internet. These are logic puzzles where you ask
        questions that can only be answered with "Yes" or "No" (or "Unknown/Not Answerable") to a person that
        has seen the answer beforehand. The goal is to figure out the mistery in each scenario.

        Choose a difficulty level,
        then click on a puzzle title to reveal its question,
        and then click the question to see the answer.
